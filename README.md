Build a Neural Net in 9 lines of code (python 3 working edition)

## Intro

This is the working code (debugged for Python 3) for "How to build a simple neural network in 9 lines of Python code" by Milo Harper found [here.](https://medium.com/technology-invention-and-more/how-to-build-a-simple-neural-network-in-9-lines-of-python-code-cc8f23647ca1)

##Overview

There were a few bugs, mainly syntax issues, with the original code that stopped it from working in Python 3. This code fixes those problems. 

##Dependencies

Just Numpy, from numpy import exp, array, random, dot

##Usage

Run python short_version.py in terminal to see it train, then predict.

##Credits

Credits go to [Milo Harper](https://github.com/miloharper) & anybody else who contributed to the original code. I've modified the code ever so lightly so it works in Python 3.

NB I used Python version 3.7.1 + Sublime Text 3 version 3.2.1, Build 3207, at the time of this update/commit.
